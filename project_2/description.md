Automate header reporting (If you are reading this please use this tool or something else for this kind of task. For real. Trust me taking screenshots from burpsuite to show some header is missing is not fun)

Beginner:
-Input URL and detect if HSTS is missing
Intermediate:
-Input multiple URLs and output findings along IP from URL
Expert:
-Detect if CSP and X-Frame-Options are missing. If server header is present output its contents. 

Bonus:
-If there's no HTTPs, set HSTS as missing and move along with other headers
